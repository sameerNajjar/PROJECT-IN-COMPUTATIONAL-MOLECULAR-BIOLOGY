# Weekly Progress

## Week 1:

- **Database Selection:**  
  Spent time researching various protein alignment benchmark datasets. Explored options like Pfam, SABmark, and OXBench, many of these databeses links where outdated or hard to find so in the end I settled on **BaliBASE** database.
- **Data Extraction & Initial Experimentation:**  
  Implemented a simple Python script to:
  1. Extract the protein sequences from the **BaliBASE** dataset.
  2. Process these sequences using **ESM2** to generate sequence embeddings.
