# Project: protein structure alignment using ESM Models and Dynamic Programming

Supervisor: prof. Rachel Kolodny<br>

## Overview

This project aims to explore and improve protein sequence alignment techniques by leveraging the power of transformer-based language models developed for proteins. Initially, we will work with **ESM2** (a protein language model) to extract embeddings for protein sequences, then apply dynamic programming on these embeddings to find optimal sequence alignments. If this approach is successful, the Project will be extended to **ESM3** but this time the target is protein structure alignment using the same approach.
